* My first step is to take @yallop script to generate ctypes bindings and make it generate some OCaml parse tree instead of generating OCaml sources so I try to find some ways of integrating it easily in a Reason/OCaml flow. One of the goal would be trying to avoid as much as possible fighting with a build system
* I also took some time to finish a Reason js_of_ocaml REPL I started some months ago. We will probably communicate about it soon publicly, but for now itâ€™s available there: https://engil.github.io/reason-web-toplevel/
