* TLS: Implemented a few simple clients and servers using various C TLS libraries (libtls, mbedtls) to understand their API. Started to implement the binding trying to replicate libtls's interface.
* Various things on Canopy (bugfixes)
* Spent some time playing with Reason (reading the doc, tried to implement a web toplevel for Reason using js_of_ocaml), tried to debug an issue with ocaml-git
