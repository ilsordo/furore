These are annual reviews of the activities of OCaml Labs -- an initiative within the Cambridge Computer Laboratory started by Anil Madhavapeddy in 2011 to promote research, growth and collaboration within the wider OCaml community. We contribute to management of the day-to-day OCaml maintenance load, and align research agendas with real-world projects to help progress the language and make it available and applicable to a larger audience. Together with INRIA and our other partners, our goal is to freely release and integrate all work upstream, allowing all prospective users access to the efficient, expressive language of OCaml.
