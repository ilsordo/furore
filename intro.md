# OCaml Labs

**Note: This is a work in progress draft document**

### An Introduction

OCaml Labs is an initiative within the Cambridge Computer Laboratory started by Anil Madhavapeddy in 2011 to promote research, growth and collaboration within the wider OCaml community. We contribute to management of the day-to-day OCaml maintenance load, and align research agendas with real-world projects to help progress the language and make it available and applicable to a larger audience. Building on 40 years of language development, together with INRIA our goal is to freely release and integrate all work upstream, allowing all prospective users access to the efficient, expressive language of OCaml.

This report details the work carried out by our group in 2016 and outlines prospective projects for 2017. _TODO link to previous years posts?_

## 2016: An Overview

The OCaml Labs team is a distributed group of 50+ people, comprised of researchers at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, industrial partners, student interns and individual collaborators. From a combination of research grant and industrial funding we are able to fund a small full-time team at the University of Cambridge, 2-4 student interns each academic year and regular community events to encourage contribution and collaboration.

### OCaml Compiler

This refers to the core compiler toolchain, OCaml language and runtime system. Our work includes daily maintenance such as bug fixes and long term improvements to the type system and runtime libraries. We are actively engaging with the wider OCaml community to ensure that improvements and modifications we propose are thoroughly discussed, well-formulated and maintainable. 2016 has featured significant work towards multicore support for parallelism and concurrency in OCaml together with greater faciliation for metaprogramming approaches.

### OCaml Platform

The Platform combines the core OCaml compiler with a coherent set of libraries, tools and documentation. We look to large-scale users of OCaml to guide the direction of development in this area, including Jane Street, MirageOS, Docker and Facebook. 2016 has seen a focus on the developer experience; tooling improvements around packaging, build and test infrastructure; and support for different operating systems and infrastructures.

### [Community and Outreach](./community-and-outreach.md)

We regularly host community events based around functional programming and OCaml. 2016 was a busy year for us and we hosted lots of events including 4 compiler development sessions in Cambridge; the first MirageOS hackathon in Marrakech, followed by a local Cambridge MirageOS event; the 2016 OpenBSD summit; and the first International Metaprogramming Summer School at Robinson College. 

Together with academic appearances, members of the OCaml Labs team present their work to the wider community including programming groups, students, financial groups and other development teams - most notably Facebook this year. 

Encouraging community contribution and engagement has been a focus of this year, with consideration given to onboarding new users, surfacing and documenting small-scale projects, and developing strategies for efficient maintainership of our shared repositiories and code. We started the OCaml Labs Slack group to enable easy communication amongst our widely distributed group, and we have >100 active users.
